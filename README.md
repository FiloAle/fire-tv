This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that mocks the existing Fire TV remote mobile application, with the aim of controlling a Figma prototype of the Fire TV UI by simulating keystrokes when pressing navigation buttons from the smartphone.

## Try it out by yourself

First of all, make sure you have [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) installed on your computer.

Then, run the development server with `npm run dev`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For a better experience, open the server's link (<IP address>:3000) from your smartphone's browser.
